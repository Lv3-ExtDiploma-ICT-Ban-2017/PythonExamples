"""01-HelloWorld.py: Simple example of printing and variables"""

# Lets start off simple, were gonna print hello world
print("Hello World!")  # Output:>Hello World!
# Now, wasn't that fun.
# This can be useful when the text to be printed is known from the start, but this can get tedious

# Lets create a variable
spam = "eggs"  # monty python reference. Fun fact, the name python was inspired by monty python franchise
print(spam)  # Output:>eggs
# What???, we said spam, but it printed "eggs", do not fear, variables are here
